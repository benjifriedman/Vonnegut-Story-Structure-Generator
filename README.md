## Features

- Randomly generated plotlines with varying nodes
- Plotlines are drawn using quadratic Bezier curves for smooth transitions
- Each plotline is assigned a random color and line width
- The y-axis represents the emotional scale, ranging from "Very Bad" to "Very Good"
- The x-axis represents the progression of the story, labeled with "Beginning," "Middle," and "Ending"
- Some plotlines will feature an "Off the chart happiness" ending, where the final node extends beyond the top of the chart and an infinity symbol is displayed

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser
2. The application will display a random plotline on the graph
3. Click the "New Plotline" button to generate a new random plotline
4. Observe the different shapes and endings of the generated plotlines
5. Click the info button in the top left corner to learn more about the project

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas for drawing the graph and plotlines
- JavaScript for generating random plotlines and handling user interactions
- CSS for styling the application and modal

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by Kurt Vonnegut's concept of the ["Shape of Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP3c1h8v2ZQ)," where he proposed that the emotional arcs of stories can be mapped onto a simple graph. The Emotional Plotline Generator aims to visualize and explore the variety of possible emotional trajectories a story can take.
